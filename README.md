# My First Page

Hey all,

I am new to coding and all, so I am learning all kind of new things like github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc..
This is nothing special, I am following a course on Udemy to get better at web development. This is my first ever website created, and I am kind of happy about it; nothing too special, because it is plain HTML. I will update this repository a few times, with, hopefully, some better UI and features.
You guys will also see me improve, I hope, because this will always be my go to page to add things I learned and fit into this page.

For the next few days, I plan on improving the layout and adding some extra features, like a menu bar.

I hope that I will post better and better projects on github in the near future.

Cheers,

Jacek.
