# Personal-site

Hey all,

I am new to coding and all, so I am learning all kind new things like github.
This is nothing special, I am following a course on Udemy to be better at web development. This is my first ever website created, and I am kind of happy about it.

I hope that I will post better and better projects on github in the near future.

Cheers,

Jacek
